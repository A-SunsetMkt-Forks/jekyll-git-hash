Copy `jekyll-git-hash.rb` file to your `_plugins` directory.

Use `{{ site.data['hash']}}` inside your liquid template.

When the site is being generated by Jekyll, the
plugin retrieves Git hash of the source code and
exposes it as a item in `site.data`. This feature
is very helpful when you want your static resources (CSS, JS, etc.)
be reloaded by end users every time you deploy a new
version of the site.

For example, in your `default.html`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/layout.css?{{ site.data['hash'] }}"/>
```

The URL will be generated with a suffix at the end. This
suffix doesn't change the URL (`layout.css` will still
be accesible by the browser), but it makes the URL unique
for the browser when you deploy a new Git revision. All browsers
will reload this CSS.
